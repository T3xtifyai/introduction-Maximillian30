PROBLEM STATEMENT:
IDEATE POSSIBLE WAYS TO MONETIZE B2C A.I SOLUTIONS.

INTRODUCTION: B2C which is short for business-to-customer is a commerce model between a business and an individual consumer. It is done via bringing your products and services to your customers. This business model has been widely adopted by e-commerce stores as it offers better ways to a large pool of customers without having to own building or a physical store. With the popularity that A.I has gained over the years and in recent times that so many A.I solutions are offering better ways of conducting business it should not come as a surprise that B2C model has adopted the technology and companies already are rolling out B2C A.I solutions. A question that is left hanging is that how can B2C A.I solutions be monetized and I have identified possible ways monetization can be achieved.
SOLUTIONS:   There are ways in which B2C A.I solutions can be monetized and out of the pool of possible ways in which it can be monetized, I have identified 4 ways that suits the B2C A.I solution monetization strategy. These includes;
1.	Pay-as-you-use –Model: Widely adopted by Cloud Companies, This pay-as-you-go monetization strategy has a low barrier to entry for customers, as it offers flexibility around their needs, and there's no commitment. It allows a user to pay a one-time cost for the software to gain access and use it at that particular time. If they need it again, they pay for it again. In short, the user will only pay for the application when the need arises. You can use this monetization strategy to diversify your clientele, including those who don't favor other pricing models and acquire those who prefer a more controlled and flexible pricing plan. 

2.	Licensing A.I solutions: a software license is a legal tool governing the distribution and use of your software. License models can protect your intellectual property in source and object-code forms. This strategy offers software protection and safeguards your product against any infringement, including software piracy, unauthorized duplication, sharing or using your intellectual property etc.

3.	Freemium Model: This will see you give part of your software on app stores for free to your user base. In a saturated software market, a freemium strategy reduces purchase barriers and encourages an end-user to sign in and try out your software product. Acquiring clients through ads, sales, and marketing can result in high customer acquisition costs (CAC). A freemium app monetization strategy can substantially reduce CAC. The goal of freemium is to convince your growing clientele to use the free version and enhance customer experience enough to convince them to pay and experience all functionalities of the software. You can use the freemium model to prove to your clientele that you can provide a positive and engaging user experience in both the free and locked versions.

4.	Open-source Model: This developer-focused strategy allows developers to 'throw' their code out there for everyone to access, customize, and control. There's a lot of money in the open-source ecosystem. Open source code is free and offers features that help end users perform their daily tasks, customized to meet their business needs. However, monetization applies when an end-user needs additional technical support, premium features, hosting services, and SaaS. You can use open source when you want to create an engaging user experience while allowing users to contribute to the improvement of your solution.

These strategies are best and possible ways you can monetize your B2C A.I solutions. Now let’s take a look at how to monetize your solution/services successfully and staying ahead.
1.	Understand market trends: Understanding the trends in the market is vital because the market is dynamic and so it changes. So when you try out one strategy and it does not fit, try and another according to market trends.

2.	Protect your intellectual property: To avoid infringement on your intellectual property, familiarize yourself with various modes of IP protection such as copyright, trademarks, and NDAs. Include an IP clause in your software terms. Understanding IP protection will help decide which software monetization strategy to employ.

3.	Leverage customer feedback in product development: Research shows 52% of consumers prefer businesses to take action on customer feedback. As one of the vital aspects of your software development, software companies are encouraged to engage directly with the clients about their experience using the software. Use this feedback to decide on the best software monetization strategy to use.

4.	Track revenue performance: Analyzing and improving sales and marketing efforts using revenue as the base indicator reveals which monetization strategy drives the most revenue. Revenue Performance Management (RPM) will guide you in achieving ROI and accelerated top-line growth.

5.	And last but the list regularly adjust your pricing to accommodate market variations or to accommodate customer’s pain.
